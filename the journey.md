Each phase delivers value you keep. But the real power is stacking them: each phase feeds the next.

---

### **Phase 1: Research & Positioning (Month 1)**

The knowledge foundation that powers everything else.

**What happens:**

- **Deep market research:** Competitors, alternatives, ecosystem mapping, market positioning. AI agents comb through news, podcasts, reviews, and case studies to understand the landscape.
- **ICP refinement:** Your Ideal Customer Profile gets defined with real data, not assumptions. What size companies? Which industries? Which roles make buying decisions? What problems do they have budget to solve?
- **Positioning and messaging:** Validated with friendly customers and real conversations, not pulled from thin air.
- **Asset alignment:** Website, pitch decks, LinkedIn profiles, and sales collateral get refreshed so everything speaks the same language.

**What you get:**

- A structured knowledge base that AI agents can query so every email, call prep, and reply draws from it
- Sales assets that land with prospects
- Clear targeting: who to reach, why they'll care, how to find them

**Deliverables:** Market research report, ICP documentation, positioning framework, refreshed sales assets. All yours to keep.

### **Phase 2: Activation & Tooling (Months 2-3)**

The engine that finds and activates high-fit prospects.

**What happens:**

- **Tiered enrichment:** A budget-protecting waterfall. Cheap firmographic checks first, then AI validation for qualitative fit, then deep research to filter out high value targets.
- **Ghost Profile discovery:** Besides our 25 data provides the engine can find persona’s who aren't active on LinkedIn by scraping company sites, blogs, forums, and news.
- **Multi-source activation:** Act on real buying signals: intent data showing who's researching solutions like yours, event attendance, funding announcements, job changes, social engagement. Reach out when there's a reason, not randomly.
- **Campaign execution:** Continuous A/B testing of messaging and channels. What works gets scaled, what doesn’t gets killed.

**What you get:**  A qualified pipeline of prospects who have reasons to care, and infrastructure that scales.

**Deliverables:** Prospect activation system, enriched target lists, campaign templates, performance dashboard.

### **Phase 3: Sales Execution (Months 3-5)**

Scaling deal flow with AI-augmented workflow.

**What happens:**

- **Reply Agent:** When a prospect replies, AI pulls full conversation history, queries your knowledge base, and drafts a context-aware response. Generated drafts appear in your drafts folder for review, regardless of your email client.
- **Call Prep Agent:** Delivers a briefing before every meeting: conversation history, company research, 3 to 5 hooks based on your sales playbook, recommended talking points. Reply to the email to ask follow-up questions. It has full context loaded.
- **Post-Meeting Agent:** Every interaction gets transcribed, whether online, phone, or even voice notes from in-person meetings. You get follow-up email drafts, researched answers to unanswered questions, and next-step recommendations. The agent adapts to deal stage: detailed follow-ups after discovery calls, draft proposals after technical deep-dives.
- **Sales playbook development:** Our team co-runs the first discovery calls. What works gets documented and built into a structured playbook. When objections come up, responses get added. When new patterns emerge, the playbook gets updated.
- **Multi-channel re-activation:** If email goes cold, shift to LinkedIn. If LinkedIn doesn't work, try WhatsApp or phone. Never lose a deal because you got stuck in one blocked channel.

**What you get:**

- Sales reps moving faster with less time on admin and more time selling
- Higher close rates from better prep, faster follow-up, and consistent messaging
- Playbooks that new hires can follow from day one
- A system that learns from every interaction

**Deliverables:** AI agents embedded in your workflow, documented sales playbooks, call transcription system, multi-channel orchestration.

### **Phase 4: RevOps Intelligence (Month 6+)**

Harvesting the data foundation built in Phases 1-3 to drive strategy.

**What happens:**

- **Unit economics:** Hard data on cost per discovery call, stage-by-stage drop-offs, and true channel ROI (cost per *closed* deal).
- **Win/loss analysis:** Mining closed deals to see what *actually* drives decisions—price, features, or timing—and feeding that back into targeting.
- **Conversation-to-content loops:** Surfacing the actual language prospects use in calls to rewrite your positioning and assets.
- **Strategic partnership:** Leadership deep-dives on pipeline health, market signal synthesis, and validating new markets before you commit resources.

**What you get:**

- A growth engine that gets smarter every month as data compounds, playbooks improve, and targeting sharpens
- Strategic counsel that turns data into direction instead of just dashboards to watch
- The ability to spin up new markets or verticals without starting from scratch because infrastructure is already in place

**Deliverables:** Unit economics reporting, win/loss analysis framework, updated playbooks and positioning, ongoing strategic advisory. The Knowledge Engine keeps growing. Each month's data makes the next month smarter.
